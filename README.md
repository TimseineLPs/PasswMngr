# Password Manager
A password generator/keychain written in Python3 using AES for encryption.

NOTE: This is very Work in progress and MOSTLY DOES NOT WORK AT ALL right now.
The Text only Version(textVersion.py) is functional at this point.

If you notice any weakness in the way the data is encrypted, please let me know (tim.hartmann@urd-online.de) so I can fix it.

Once the GUI is done i will provide the program in compiled form for Windows and Linux
